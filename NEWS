* create_sql bug fix for msms spectra table. Was crashing due to incorrect ordering.
* Add peak processing (flag remove peaks) for LC-MS XCMS data
* Add option to for frag4feature to just link to the grouped peak rtmin and rtmax (e.g. do not need to link to individual files)

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.6.1
=========================
* Bug fix. For pos/neg switching acquisition two files are can be generated when converting from RAW to mzML (1 for pos, 1 for neg).   The resulting files retention time scans were not being tracked properly in msPurity in these cases. This is now fixed. Thanks
